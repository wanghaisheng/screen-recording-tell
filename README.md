>Tarsier visually tags interactable elements on a page via brackets + an ID e.g. [23]. In doing this, we provide a mapping between elements and IDs for an LLM to take actions upon (e.g. CLICK [23]). We define interactable elements as buttons, links, or input fields that are visible on the page; Tarsier can also tag all textual elements if you pass tag_text_elements=True.
